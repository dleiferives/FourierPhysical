A simple Fourier solver for a curve on a line. Written in my sophmore year of highschool. Inspired after learning about fourier series at a Berkely splash course. Intended to export a physical design, (via Fusion360 scripting), that would automatically create a physical device with gearing, that would then trace out the design.
